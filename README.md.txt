Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  This Inventory Application needs features for user to be able to sign up, log in, add or remove items and product and receive a text alert when a product is out of stock, or its quantity gets down to zero.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?


The first screen should be log in and sign-up screens which user can register a new account to log back into the system. After verification of the user, they have access to the inventory system, and depending on their roles, their access to add, delete or edit items should be different (this is a feature that I would like to add in the future updates). The inventory system can accept item name, description, and easily increase or decrease quantity of a product by clicking + or -.

 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  Since Android was very new to me, I had to do a lot of research on how to properly code functions, such as SQLite databases, alert dialogs, and lists. This taught me how to look for solutions to problems. Research is very important in system development, especially if the developer is asked to build something they have no prior knowledge of that subject.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

After any changes or adding new line of code, I make sure to run the application and check for possible errors or issues. Also, using breakpoints and debugging was helpful to find out where and how the errors happen. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I have not added this feature yet, but I am working on scanning feature to be able to read barcode, as well as the name of product using phoneâ€™s camera, which makes users job easy and prevent mistakes due to typing or distraction.
